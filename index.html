	<h1>Stock symbols</h1>
	If you want to use a stock library like <a href="https://github.com/sstrickx/yahoofinance-api">this</a> to work with some data. It may be a difficulty that in europe the ISIN is a more common identifier than the symbols used by the library.
	<br/>
	To solve this I have collected a list of about 5k symbols and mapped them to companies and their ISIN. All in a simple parseable json.
	<br/>
	<a href="companies.json">Link to json</a>
	<br/>
	</article>
	<article id="example">
	<h1>Example</h1>
	the following is an example how the json structure looks like.
	<br/>
	There is some base info like the name and the location of the company, also there are some tags which industry the company is working in.
	<br/>
	The ISIN is an array, because there are some companies with multiple stock options and therefore multiple ISIN numbers.
	<br/>
	Also there is a list which indices contain this stock
	<br/>
	And finaly there is a list of symbols for the stock with the additional info of the currency and the exchange where the symbol belongs to.
