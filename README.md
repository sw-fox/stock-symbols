# stock-symbols

If you want to use a stock library like [this](https://github.com/sstrickx/yahoofinance-api") to work with some data. It may be a difficulty that in europe the ISIN is a more common identifier than the symbols used by the library.

To solve this I have collected a list of about 5k symbols and mapped them to companies and their ISIN. All in a simple parseable json.
